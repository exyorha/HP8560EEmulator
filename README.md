# HP8560EEmulator

HP8560EEmulator implements a partial emulation of Hewlett-Packard 8560E
spectrum analyzer, providing most of the controller board, portions of the
interface board, and a simulation of the front panel. Generally, enough
hardware is implemented to keep the original firmware running and responsive
to the user input.

This emulator was originally created to faciliate reverse engineering of the
vector graphics ASIC on the controller board, and does not have any
measurement capabilities.
